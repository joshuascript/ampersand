/// This is the ONLY way ampersand enters the container. Spawning run-in-sniper
/// straight off the filesystem does not work on Ubuntu 24.04+, and fails in a way
/// that misreports its own cause: with
/// kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1 the kernel exempts exactly two
/// things, /usr/bin/bwrap and Steam's own tree. pressure-vessel prefers the
/// runtime's srt-bwrap, which is neither, so it runs unconfined, cannot write
/// uid_map, and falls back to /usr/bin/bwrap - whose profile stacks every child
/// into unpriv_bwrap with no CAP_SYS_ADMIN. The nested srt-bwrap then dies with
/// "No permissions to create a new namespace", blaming kernel switches that are
/// fine. See docs/sniper-userns-apparmor.md.
///
/// Sent through this service the command runs as a child of Steam, whose profile
/// is flags=(unconfined) and grants userns to its whole tree, so srt-bwrap
/// succeeds on the first attempt and the fallback is never taken. Verified:
/// `--alongside-steam -- cat /proc/self/attr/current` prints "steam (unconfined)".
